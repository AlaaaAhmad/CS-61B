# Essentials
1- All Java Programs must go inside a class.

2- The code that runs must be inside the main method

3- To Run a java program, you may go throughout some steps compiling and then interpreting: 
    
     * javac fileName.java
     * java fileName
     
      Here we have compiled the file, so we get a .class file which is a bytecode, 
      this byte code is then interpreted to the machine code so it can run.

4- Java is a static typed language, if there is an error, it arises during compilation time. 

5- Nice observation, consider the following two codes in java and python..
```Python
   print(5 + "Hello")
  #This ends up with an error
```

```Java
  public class printing {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println(5 + "Hello"); 
    }
    // This runs without errors
}
```
The previous code in python ends up with an error because python is dynamically typed, 
so it doesn't know the type of the values whether it should treat them as strings or integers, 
while in java, it's statically typed, so it concatenates the 5 and Hello as one string.


## Some Style Guides

* List<integer<integer>> not List< integer >
* x++ not x ++
* don't put a white space before ; 
* while (x > y) not while ( x > y ) 
* x.length not x. length
* String (x) not String(x)
* a + b = c not a+b=c
* better to put { in the same line
* classes start with a capital letter
* packages, variables, and parameters better start with a lower case letter
*
